Easy Grocery is a simple web application that allows users to browse and purchase grocery items. The application fetches data from a JSON file and dynamically displays the available grocery items. Users can search for specific items, add them to their shopping cart, and view the total price of their selected items.




Features
Item Search: Users can enter a search query in the search bar to filter the displayed grocery items based on their name.
Add to Cart: Each grocery item card has an "Add to Cart" button that users can click to add the item to their shopping cart.
Shopping Cart: Users can view the items they have added to their shopping cart. The cart displays the item details, allows users to adjust the quantity of each item, and shows the total price of all selected items.
Dark Mode: The application includes a dark mode toggle button that users can click to switch between a light and dark theme.
